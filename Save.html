            Great Ways to Save Water At Home
           </h2>
           
           <p>
            <h3>Saving Water While Taking Showers </h3>
          If you want to be water-wise, always choose a shower over a bath. An average, comfortable bath will set you back
            80 litres of hot water. The average 8-minute shower uses only approximately 60 litres of hot water.
            But if that still sounds like a lot of water to waste on a single use, you’re not wrong. That’s why we’d like 
            to teach you a super simple way to save the water from your shower for reuse (in your garden, to flush your 
            toilets, to wash your floors, the list goes on).
            The solution to shower water wastage is simple; shower with a bucket!
            If this sounds like far too much effort, the least you could do is fit your shower with a new,
             high-tech low-flow shower head. These shower heads reduce your water consumption by up to 
            75% without leaving you feeling like you’re standing under a slow drip instead of a shower.

            <h3>Dishes & Laundry Water Can Be Used Again </h3>
            There are a myriad of ways to save water in and around the kitchen and laundry-room.
            One of the quickest, easiest ways to save water is by capturing the “warm-up” water when you 
            wash dishes or do any of your hand washing in the laundry. This can be easily achieved by placing 
            a bowl or bucket under the tap while you let the water run to warm up.If you’re up for greywater recycling,
             capturing the runoff from your dishwasher or washing machine in a reservoir or large plastic
             bins means you can flush toilets, water gardens, or even wash the dog without having to use more potable water!

           <p><h3>Fixing That Unnecessary Leaks Around The House</h3>
            Here are some quick and easy ways to check:
            <br/>
            Toilet:
            <br/>
            If you want to check for a leak in your toilet, drop a couple of drops of food 
            colouring into your toilet tank or cistern and wait 24 hours.
            If, after 24 hours, the water in the toilet bowl has changed colour and matches 
            the colour of the water in the cistern without your having flushed the toilet, it means you have a leak.
            <br/>
            Taps:
            <br/>
            Leave a bowl underneath taps, or the plug in the sink, overnight and check if any water has
             accumulated by the morning, if so, you have a leak.
             <br/>
             If you don’t know how to fix leaks yourself, or don’t mind continuing in this fashion, you can always 
             avoid water wastage from a leaky tap by just continuing to
              collect the dripping water in a bowl or bucket and using it elsewhere instead of sending it straight down the drain.

            <p><h3>Watering Times Play A Great Role To Save Water </h3>
                If you’re going to be watering your garden or fruit and vegetable patch with potable water,
                opposed to with greywater, you should at least be doing so in the most efficient, and water-wise way possible.
                This is why, when municipalities impose water restrictions, they come with a garden watering guideline. 
                Usually these guidelines stipulate a time of day and duration for which you are allowed to water your 
                garden.It is important to note that watering your garden before midday allows water enough
                 time to reach your plants’ root systems before the midday sun starts to accelerate the evaporation processes.
