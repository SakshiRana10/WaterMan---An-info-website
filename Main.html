          <h3><b>Sonoma Wine Country Prepares for Drought</b></h3><br />
          <h4>In news - May 26, 2021</h4><br/>
          Sonoma wine country is preparing itself for a drought that has caused the area to look like it’s July instead of May.
          Sonoma wine country is dealing with another potential economic blow. Last year, fires hit Sonoma and 
          Napa Counties, and the entire state had to deal with pandemic-related closures.<br/> This year, the area is
           parched from the extreme to exceptional drought that has gripped a large portion of the state, including Sonoma
            County, and it’s already affecting grape production.<br/>
          Grapes are the highest value fruit crop grown in the US and, while wine is grown in all 50 states, 
          California produces 85 percent of all wine in the country. Wine has a relatively high water footprint, 
          especially in the US where the vines are irrigated, even though irrigation is controversial because it can
           change a wine’s ‘terrior‘ – the taste that reflects where and how the grapes were grown. Irrigation can 
           increase a vineyard’s productivity but it can ruin the terroir of a grape. Nevertheless, in the US, as 
           investors have increasingly influenced vineyard practices, productivity has trumped taste, and many operations
           have embraced irrigation. <br />
          The practice is especially problematic once drought settles into a region, as is the current situation in 
            the western US.

          <h3><b>Water Governance and Urban Drinking Water Crisis in India</b></h3><br/>
          <h4>In news - April 29, 2021</h4><br/>
          Unarguably, water is essential to life. And safe drinking water is quintessential for survival. It plays a 
          pivotal role in ensuring good health as it helps channelise the metabolic processes of the body. More so, in 
          the current COVID scenario, water helps stay healthy because proper hydration works as an important factor, helping
           your body fight the COVID virus. Yet, from Cape Town to Flint, Michigan, and from rural, sub-Saharan Africa to 
           Asia’seming megacities, there’s a global water crisis.<br/>
          Despite the progress towards making clean water accessible globally, people lacking access to clean water
           decreasing from 1.1 billion in 2000 to 785 million in 2017, still numerous water accessibility problems remain. 
           Women and girls spend an estimated 200 million hours hauling water every day. And more than 800 children under 5
            die from diarrhoea caused by contaminated water every day.<br/><br/>
            According to estimates, India has 16% of the world’s population but only 4% of the world’s freshwater resources. 
            Despite significant investment and improvement in the water sector, it is becoming very difficult to manage the 
            ever-increasing demand for water in India.

          <h3><b>Access to water and COVID-19: seven measures countries in Asia can take now</b></h3><br/>
          <h4>In news - June 23, 2020</h4><br/>
          More than 40 percent of the world’s population lacks access to adequate handwashing facilities, 
          even though handwashing is an effective way to help prevent spreading COVID-19. <br/>
               According to the Stockholm Environment Institute, there are seven measures that Asian countries can take 
               now to ensure equitable access to safe drinking water and handwashing facilities during the pandemic:<br/>

1) Immediately budget available water resources from different sources against priority needs for the summer months.<br/>
2) Initiate emergency measures, including tapping water from alternative sources such as groundwater, supply through 
tankers, and incentives for farmers.<br/>
3) Identify hotspots of water insecurity in urban and rural areas to plan and implement contingency measures.<br/>
4) In case of expected acute water shortages, plan alternative ways to support hand hygiene.<br/>
5) Adopt a policy decision to defer water utility bills until the pandemic crisis ends.<br/>
6) Under lockdown, ensure vulnerable groups have adequate access to water, such as women and girls facing heightened
 pressure to fetch water.<br/>
7) Communicate clearly so that people use community handwashing facilities in a way that minimizes crowding and contact.
